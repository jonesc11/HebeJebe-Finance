# HebeJebe Finance

Our team will be developing an API and web application that will help people keep track of their financial information, and help them budget their money according to their monthly income and payments. 
The app will keep track of your transaction history so a user can see what they spend most of their money on, and will allow them to separate their money into “sub-balances,” or smaller amounts, that 
are set aside for a specific purposes like rent or car payments. It will also project how much money the user will have after a period of time, so a user can see how long their current amount of money 
will suffice.
